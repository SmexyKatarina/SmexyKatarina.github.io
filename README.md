# TODO

This is a temporary README file, it is simply for handling all of the features listed below in a orderly fashion

All features listed could make it into the final product or it could not, nothing listed is going to 100% be what it says.

New features could/can be added later on after the MVP is created and up and running.

  - Simple icon
  - Opening/closing animation

    - ~~Contains some simple information to cut into the different pages~~
    - ~~Pages include but not limited to; projects, social media, about, contact~~
    - ~~Summarys of the individual pages with *least* information given to prevent copy and pasting into other routes~~
  - Projects page
    - ~~Projects will be grabbed from the GitHub API and put through into the page grabbing all my currently *public* projects~~ Impossible to do through GitHub pages without hosting a server to grab the info from which is out of the scope that I wanted
    - Projects will be manually imported for now until a better hosting solution is viable.
    - All projects will be in some sort of tiling function
    - ~~Clicking on a project will bring it to an information page about the project. (Date created, last updated, used languages, etc)~~ Moved to main page until projects can be grabbed

    - Some hobbys, activitys, daily schedule, etc.
  - Contact
    - Any contact information that is required to reach me directly.
    - Availability

- Interactivity, Styling and accessability
  - Make website as interactable as possible and make it easy to notice something interactable
  - Styling to accomodate legibility of the text and positioning of the text
  - Accessability towards different screen users, mobile and such.
 
- Other things to think about
  - Maybe make a form to send a direct email
